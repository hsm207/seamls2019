# Introduction

This repository contains slides presented at the [South East Asia Machine Learning School (SEA MLS) 2019](https://www.sea-mls.com/). 
SEA MLS 2019 was a 5-day event held at Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Greater Jakarta, Indonesia between
July 8 to July 12, 2019. It had the following sessions:

* **Lecture sessions** from top machine learning experts and invited speakers (both basic and more advanced topics were covered);
* **Interactive practical sessions** where participants had the chance to directly try out and implement models described in the lectures;
* **Panel sessions** with machine learning researchers, practitioners, industry leaders, and government representatives about current challenges in AI;
* **Research presentation sessions** where participants showcased their past work and projects to get feedback from fellow participants and invited speakers; and
* **Social events** with the event's sponsors.
